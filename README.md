Programming language choices pros and cons:

C#.NET:
Pros:
- Great for async operations
- Works well for making GUIs
- Made for Windows
Cons:
- Performance may be a concern

Rust:
Pros:
- Not garbage-collected
- Strong type system
Cons:
- Not good for GUIs

C++:
Pros:
- Low-level
- Large community support
Cons:
- Security risks
- Pointers
- Absence of built-in threads
- Not good for GUIs

My choice of programming language for this project is C#.NET because it would be the easiest to make a GUI with. Additionally, C#.NET is plenty powerful to track application activity in the background. One final consideration is the idea of having the tracker and the GUI in the same language, and I feel that C#.NET would work well for that.
